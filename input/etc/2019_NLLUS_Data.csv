Accordingly, any applicant for a project that sets aside at least 30% of units for households meeting certain income levels is provided a higher level of deference by the courts.  If an applicant of such a project appeals a Town decision to deny (or approve with certain conditions), the burden in on the Town to demonstrate that the conditions/reasons for denial outweigh the need for affordable housing. Based on case law, that is a very difficult standard to meet.

Additionally, the question regarding review of outside agencies was confusing as many of these areas of review (stormwater, fire/emergency services) are performed by Town government. My answers reflect the type/frequency of review for those topics, not that these reviews are performed by other agencies.  Lastly, we are in the lengthy and arduous process of completely rewriting our zoning regulations (the first comprehensive rewrite since they were adopted in the 1950s). As part of that process, I expect additional districts to address multi-family housing as well as new districts that will allow for smaller single-family lots in areas with access to the public sewer and water service needed to support smaller lots.",,,,"","",1,"",0,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,"Other incentives:",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,".n",1,1,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,2,2

In fact, the challenge has been attracting housing development in a community that has over 50% renter occupancy and high rate of vacant housing.  However, the redevelopment of the former Fort Gillem to a Logistic Center with national tenants such a Kroger (1M sq. ft), Cummings and HD Supply signal that develop interest on the housing side is likely to pick up. The pricing escalation in Atlanta proper could be another factor why development may begin to move south of the City.  The City of Forest Park has anticipated possible development interest and through a current housing initiative led by the Mayor intends to shape the housing context of the City. The initiative focuses on identifying redevelopment opportunities through public private partnerships that will provide new market-rate and work-force  housing along with affordable senior housing.",,,,"","",1,"",0,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,"",.s,.s,.s,.s,.s,.s,.s,.s,0,1,.s,.s,.s,.n,.n,.n,".n",4,1,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,1,1

My jurisdiction has also eliminated minimum floor areas for single-family residences since 2012.  In fact, my jurisdiction is encouraging smaller size households because of the large, 2,500+ SF homes presently replacing the smaller, affordable homes.  Accessory dwelling units, either attached or detached are permitted on any legal lot of record in the residential zoning districts.  My jurisdiction allows up to 70 units per acre in its downtown and transit zoning areas, with the opportunity of a density bonus that would allow up to 84 units per acre.

However, there are some attempts to acknowledge the historical land use pattern and context--such as residential infill development standards and elimination of off-street parking requirements in large parts of the urban core.

We are embarking upon a complete re-write of the zoning ordinance that will be character-based and take into account the ""context"" of the neighborhood.  We are looking to not be calling it ""form-based"" or ""transect"".

In Michigan, we don't permit impact fees; linkage fees as far as I know are not a thing; affordable housing concessions/incentives really only were explicitly permitted by the State about a month ago (before, they were widely considered a form of rent control, which is not permitted). 
We're in the process of amending our ordinance to lower/remove some residential parking minimums by-right, and to allow planning commission discretion in other cases.
I note that intergovernmental review has increased since the mid-aughts- it's mainly because we're actually trying to coordinate with our neighbors and service providers (utilities, transit, etc) up-front rather than just causing problems for everyone once we've granted our approval. :)
We have a committee working on a housing plan, and hope to at least have some guiding policy done by the end of the year (it's a volunteer committee).",,,,"","",1,"",0,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,"",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,".n",2,1,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,1,2

That is a major re-focus for the community - given its previous development policies focused mostly on single-family development with some medium density. In 2012, the City completed a orderly annexation with the adjacent township, more than doubling the City's land area.

I'm assigning your questions to cc'd Dan Handel, Associate Planner.  He's out of the office and returns Tuesday; 

Monday is a City holiday.

Thank for for draft site plans and photo renderings.  This is much better that what potential applicants usually 

provide staff.



You can consider a supplemental checklist.  It's more specific than the generic list that



The question ""Does your jurisdiction impose fees based on a case by case review of project off-site impacts?"" is 

confusing.  Marked no.

""How much do you charge for each element of your impact fee formula?""  The fields do not allow for complicated 

answer.  They vary by (1) land use and (2) type of infrastructure (roads/streets, potable water, sanitary sewer, 

stormwater management, parks, and schools) and (3) there are a variety of formulae for the combinations.  I 

answered by best totals for SF and MF across all infrastructure.

First and foremost, being a city government in Oregon, state government strongly prescribes urban planning in 

statutes and administrative rules.  Oregon among the 50 states is one of the few that has a strongly regulated -- 

AND enforced -- urban planning program.  Much of what cities and counties do is in compliance with state law 

whether they want to or not.  The basic goal of the program is to lessen consumption of farm and forest lands by 

requiring urban growth boundaries (UGBs) for almost every incorporated city with provisions for ""periodic reviews"" 

and expansions.  Mostly recent, the state mandated that most cities allow ADUs by right with ""reasonble"" design standards.  Some cities are pushing the envelope regarding that word.

Second, thankfully the present city council and planning commission are kind and reasonable 

persons and not rabid NIMBYs.  

Third, much of Woodburn is poor.  The town stands alone in the countryside with no adjacent cities and 

surrounded by farmland.  Because the town is between the UG",,,,"","",1,"",1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,"",.s,.s,.s,.s,.s,.s,.s,.s,0,2,.n,.n,.n,0,1,0,".n",2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,2

Therefore, most higher density development occurs within the 3 respective municipal jurisdictions that also fall within our County.  The majority of our growth in the County is low density and agricultural development with some Jobs producing commercial via large warehousing and Distribution and light manufacturing facilities and a smattering of neighborhood scale retail commercial development.  Lastly, our State legislature has taken steps in recent years to limit Local Jurisdictions in Tennessee from either requiring OR incentivizing affordable housing as a part of any development review.  It is my perception that they (the legislature) is generally not opposed to affordable housing.

While there has been a statement that the need for residential housing is high, the unincorporated townships in Kenosha County, nor the two Villages where we contract service (Village of Somers and Village of Salem Lakes) have yet to see a formal preliminary subdivision plat application for either single-family or multi-family development.  We have held concept meetings on a couple projects, but still waiting for the formal application process to begin.

No jurisdictions we work with have ever discussed the idea of limiting growth/population growth within their community.  And a discussion of adequate public facilities does not take place when hearing applications for parcelization in the areas beyond the reaches of public water/sewer infrastructure.  It's a little frustrating.  Sprawl exists here.  Little thought is given to the concept of core and sphere neighborhood growth and the effect on keeping bus routes short and utility infrastructure expansion projects modest.  Public road and pedestrian connectivity is very difficult to implement.

Adopted land use plan maps are rarely followed in our rural areas.  Seems in many cases it is just another map to amend.",,,,"","",1,"",0,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,"",.s,.s,.s,.s,.s,.s,.s,.s,0,2,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,".n",2,1,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,.n,3,5
